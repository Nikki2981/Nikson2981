# i'm a they! everybody panic!

...well more accurately i'm an 'it' but still


basically none of the code i wrote since i really learned what i was doing is public. sorry! ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


I learned to program to make utility cheats for Ninecraft, tailored to a server with zero rules (meaning the modules I wrote were fundamentally different from more conventional cheats, ie. auto32k, autocrystal, bedaura).

After taking a roughly two year break from programming I am now attempting to learn C. I am not having a great time but I will keep going.
